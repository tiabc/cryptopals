# Cryptopals

This project represents my solutions to https://cryptopals.com/ challanges.

For the sake of curiosity I've decided to get acquainted with Python.
I wrote some code in it some time ago but nothing serious. This repository
can't be used to evaluate my programming level in terms of Python knowledge.

Note that the code isn't ideal, it misses many checks
and not properly structured. It was written this way deliberately for simplicity.
